 @class MKFacebookRequest
 MKFacebookRequest handles all requests to the Facebook API.  It can send requests as either POST or GET and return the results to a specified delegate and selector.  

 To send a request you must provide an instance of MKFacebookRequest with a NSDictionary containing the parameters for your request.  Included in the dictionary must be a key "method" with a value of the full Facebook method being requested, i.e. "facebook.users.getInfo".  Values that are required by all Facebook methods, "v", "api_key", "format", "session_key", "sig", and "call_id", do not need to be in the NSDictionary of parameters you pass in, they will be added automatically.
  
 
 The MKFacebookRequest class is be capable of handling most of the methods available by the Facebook API, including facebook.photos.upload.  To upload a photo using this class include a NSImage object in your NSDictionary of parameters you provide and set the method key value to "facebook.photos.upload".  The name of the key for the NSImage object can be any string.

 This class will post notifications named "MKFacebookRequestActivityStarted" and "MKFacebookRequestActivityEnded" when network activity starts and ends.  You are responsible for adding observers for handling the notifications.
 
 See the MKFacebookRequestQueue class for sending a series of requests that are sent sequentially.
 
  
 See MKFacebookRequestDelegate for information about receiving the responses from Facebook.
