 @class MKFacebook
 MKFacebook is the starting point for logging in and communicating with Facebook.  It handles displaying a login window for the user and notifying your application when a login has been successful.  

 To provide a user with a login window for your application you must do the following:
 
 1. initialize a new MKFacebook object with your API key and a delegate object
 
 2. call login or loginWithPermissions:forSheet:
 
 3. receive confirmation of a successful login via the userLoginSuccessful delegate method
 
 Delegate Methods
 
 -(void)userLoginSuccessful; (required) Called when a session has been successfully retrieved from Facebook.  Your MKFacebook delegate must implement this method, an exception will be raised if it doesn't.
